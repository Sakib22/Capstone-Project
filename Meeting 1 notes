- Family provides what could be meaningful to the patient
- Hospital will open a file based on what the family provided
- File could contain pictures, videos, music, etc
- The photos and videos would have familiar environments (home, farm,  etc)
- The photos and videos could be of where they have travelled to, or maps
- How are the files stored, and are there any privacy issues
- Family member voices recorded messages (familiar voice)
- Staff or family would press a button to initiate system
- System would be displayed in a room on a tv
- Each patient would have their own profile of files and such
- Along with the each patient, there will be group profiles, such as "shopping" or "going to the mall"
- Possibly a portable system, so that the environment can be changed (used in multiple rooms)
- Each session will most likely be 10-20 minutes, anything longer is over stimulating
- Files for each patient can be uploaded through a website
- There should be a login system so that the files are not universal, but specific to each profile
- Either login, or some sort of identification to differentiate between patients and profiles
- Doesn't have to be uploaded through the cloud, should be able to use USB
- Doesn't have to specific memories to each patient, but as long as it is a similar memory
- For example, it doesn't have to be their farm, but any farm
- Generic settings like "shopping" and "work" and "home" that staff can add to specific profiles
- Some sort of a translator ability with simple questions, "Do you need to go to the bathroom?"
- What languages do we need to support
- Should be able to display on VR headset and regular TV ------- POTENTIALLY
- QUESTION: CAN STAFF FROM THE HOSPITAL DELETE PATIENT PROFILES AFTER THE 59 DAY STAY?
- Preferably, an auto delete feature after 60 days
- The ability to transfer profiles to another location (long term care rather than dementia section)
- Possibly using sensors to see user interactions 
-
